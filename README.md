# The Nyumbani! Android App Php Backend

This is the php backend for this [Nyumbani! Android App on my public repo](https://github.com/machariamuguku/Nyumbani-A-Rental-Real-Estates-Android-Mobile-Application).

N/b: This is a very old codebase! (over two years ago - I was still a NEWBIE! use at your own risk!). I only shared because other fellow newbies are asking :man-shrugging:

## Installation

Host at any public (preferably free) host. 

I had hosted mine on [000webhost.com](https://www.000webhost.com/) but that was then and today we have [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for that.

Replace the MySQL connection strings with yours and call the url's in the android app.

Ask for my Mpesa number :smiley:
